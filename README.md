##  Introduction ðŸŒ¼

Powerful monitoring tool focused on <b>DNS monitoring</b>, utilizes the power of eBPF and python to provide real-time monitoring and actionable insights for identifying and mitigating potential threats.
  
The tool is an alternative monitoring solution for DNS traffic.
Based on open-source eBPF tool for DNS monitoring by [Nurkholish Halim](https://medium.com/@nurkholish.halim/a-deep-dive-into-ebpf-writing-an-efficient-dns-monitoring-2c9dea92abdf).

The source gist may be found [here](https://gist.github.com/oghie/b4e3accf1f87afcb939f884723e2b462).
  
 ##  Dependencies ðŸ§µ
 ###### Installation
 
  `apt install python3-dnslib python3-bpfcc bpfcc-tools libbpfcc linux-headers-$(uname -r)`
  
 ##  Usage âš™
  This tool captures outbound DNS requests and responces on a eBPF level.

Run `python3 ebpf_dns_main.py` to get started. Note: based on your Linux kernel version, it may require sudo privileges.

```
$ root@host:~/# python3 ebpf_dns_main.py
```

Sample Output:

```
The program is running. Press Ctrl-C to abort.

```
 ## Running script as a systemd service 
 To set up script automatically run as a service, copy main script to the `/etc/ebpf-dns-monitor`, and the ebpf-dns-monitor.service to the `/etc/systemd/system/`

Create a new folder under `/etc`:
 ```
 sudo mkdir /etc/ebpf-dns-monitor.
 ```
Copy the main .py script to the folder.
 ```
 cp ebpf-dns-main.py /etc/ebpf-dns-monitor/
 ```
Copy .service file to the `/etc/systemd/system/`.
 ```
 cp ebpf-dns-monitor.service /etc/systemd/system/
 ```
Reload the daemon.
 ```
 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 ```
Now we can enable the new service and start it.
 ```
 sudo systemctl enable ebpf-dns-monitor.service
 sudo systemctl start ebpf-dns-monitor.service
 sudo systemctl status ebpf-dns-monitor.service
 ```


 ##  Logging ðŸ“ˆ

The app will log all the request and responses to `/var/log/ebpf-dns-monitor.log` which can be easily monitored with Log management solutions(SIEM). 
The datetime format is RFC 3339.
